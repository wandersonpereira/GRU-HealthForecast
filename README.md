# GRU-HealthForecast
Community-driven study project to stress-test GRU models for human weight prediction based on historical weight and calorie intake data.

## Overview

GRU-HealthForecast is an open-source, community-driven study project focused on learning, evaluating, and stress-testing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for health-related time-series forecasting.

The initial use case models human health evolution using historical body weight and daily calorie intake, aiming to predict future health indicators under different behavioral patterns.

The project emphasizes understanding model behavior, robustness, and limitations rather than maximizing predictive accuracy.

## Initial Use Case

- Inputs:
  - Historical body weight (weekly)
  - Daily calorie intake
  - Basic demographic attributes

- Output:
  - Forecasted health metrics (initially body weight)
